Adventure

After both Katniss and Peeta make it out of the 74th Hunger Games alive, theyâ€™re supposed to visit all the districts of Panem on a victory tour. This instantly turns dark, as people seem to take inspiration in how Katniss broke the rules to make it possible for two people to win, instead of just one, and a rebellion dwells underneath the surface.
